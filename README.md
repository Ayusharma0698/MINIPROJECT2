 Tableau is used to visualise the data.
 Join operations are used on different files in tableau to extract data and combine them for visualisation.
 
 Dataset has 7 files.
 
 The dataset is joined using the country code. The HNPStats data file and HNP stats country file is joined using a full outer join.
 
 For the first story the country code along with the currency and trading system is used as labels and the latitude and longitude are used for the plotting of the map.
 
 For the second story the country code along with the national accounts base year and 2 alpha code are used as labels and the latitude and longitude are used for the plotting of the map.
